## General Information
- The main focus of the case study is on EDA, specifically to determine the key parameters that can help identify whether a customer is likely to default on a loan or not.
- Identifying applicants likely to repay their loans is crucial, as they can generate profits for the company through interest payments. Rejecting such applicants would result in a loss of potential business.
- On the other hand, approving loans for applicants not likely to repay and at risk of default can lead to substantial financial losses for the company.
- The loan.csv dataset is being used in this problem statement.

- Grades serve as an effective measure for identifying defaulters. Lending club should thoroughly evaluate additional borrower information prior to granting loans to individuals with Low grades.
